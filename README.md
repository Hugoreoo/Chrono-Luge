## Description

The Chrono'Luge project was developed as part of the BTS Digital Systems program at Lycée Raymond Queneau. The project aims to provide a timing system for CLECY GLISS, a company that offers its customers the thrill of descending a monorail sled track. With a unique 650m circuit in Northern France, the company wants to enhance customer enjoyment by introducing a speed challenge. This involves timing the descent, calculating the average speed, displaying the results at the end of each run, and keeping a record of the measurements. The system will enable daily and monthly challenges, fostering a competitive spirit among customers and potentially increasing the site's popularity.

## Features

- Measure the time taken for each descent.
- Calculate and display the average speed of the run.
- Show the results at the end of each run.
- Maintain a historical record of the measurements.
- Allow daily and monthly challenges.
- Encourage customers to participate in a competitive environment.
- Increase site visitation and customer engagement.

## Server Functionality

The system administrator, operating from the server, has the following capabilities:

- Add or remove sleds.
- Modify the length of the track.
- Connect the server to the company's internal network.

## Mobile Application

To provide customers with access to their race history, the project includes a mobile application. The application will allow customers to view their previous results, compare them with other participants, and keep track of their personal records.
